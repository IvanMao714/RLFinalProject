# Traffic Signal Optimization: Comparison in various Reinforcement Learning Methods -- code

This folder contains Q-learning, DQN, DDQN, DDDQN and SAC models.  

Core definitions and functions for all models could be found in the sub-folder "agent".

- Models
  - `QlearningAgent.py`
  - `DQNAgent.py`
  - `SACAgent.py`


Hyperparameters and environment settings for each model are defined in `base_settings.ini` `simulation_settings.ini` `test_setting.ini` `training_settings.ini`.


### Training and Testing

The training and testing code are in "trainer.py" and "tester.py", separately.
